_The New Sexuality: Myths, Fables & Hang-ups_, a 1972 book by psychology professor and pastor Eugene C. Kennedy, attempts a dialectical approach in the "pendulum-swing" brought on by the sexual revolution of the 1960s.

Before tackling the "myths, fables & hang-ups" of the sexual revolution, it's important to understand the basis from which Kennedy is arguing. Kennedy believes in the importance of religion in contemporary life, yet sees contemporary religion as having failed to effectively provide for individuals, having been too rigid and too focused on control:

> "Morality has had a bad name because of the immoral rigidities of previous generations whose own myths led them to misemphasize sexuality so badly. Religion--not real religion, but the superficial magic that swelled on the fundamentalistic control of man--has also had a bad name in the area of sexuality." (11)

What _should_ religion be? Kennedy reveals this most clearly at the end of the book:

> Religion [deals] with the most paramount of issues: How will we live as responsible and free human beings?... Religion's perennial task has not been to intimidate or to control man but to free him for life through lighting up its meaning for him. (209-210)

So, why is religion necessary? Might we live just as effectively without religion? Kennedy invokes the concept of _myth_ to justify the necessary role of religion. First, what is a myth?

> Myths [are what] let man talk to himself about what he has learned or what he thinks he has learned about himself and his universe... Myths enable men to... keep the world in focus without having to ask too many probing and self-disordering questions. (17)

> Man meets a perilous moment when he abandons a myth: he must put his world together anew and this is a frightening if maturing process... The laying aside of myths is paid for in anguish and uncertainty; a newly revealed truth may be compelling but at the same time painful to accept. (18)

This is a similar sort of viewpoint to that espoused by the newly popular Jordan Peterson via Russian psychology: that man's _a priori_ state is not calm confidence but _anxiety_. Just as argued by Peterson, Kennedy argues that myth is a requirement for a person to live a life free of anxiety. It is from this context of myth that Kennedy wants to discuss sexuality. He sees the sexual revolution as an explicit attempt to replace old myths with new ones, which he will systematically inspect as the meat of the book.

From all of above, we can interpret Kennedy's perspective as saying that (1) **normative myths are essential for humans to live content lives** and (2) **religion is the institution that provides broad, coherent, normative mythology intended to guide humans toward contentment**. This definition explicitly rejects fundamentalism, religion as a rigid control of behavior, and instead views religion as providing a necessary framework to answer questions of "how should I live my life?" The goal is to avoid the "anxiety" and "bewilderment" associated with contradictory myths. Contradiction avoidance requires a holistic analysis of how myths might relate to others, whether Christian or merely "old wives tales," and as such this is the method of analysis employed by Kennedy throughout the majority of the book.

His audience and motivation is revealed in the passage addressing one set of potential readers, people who are uncertain about the changing sexual environment (emphasis mine):

> This book is [addressed] to good people who are confused about the world which advertises sexual freedom so blantantly... These men and women are _anxious_ to do the right thing with their lives... They are understandably _bewildered_ in the present atmosphere and need both reassurance and encouragement that they are not strange and anachronistic human beings. They need to understand that not everything that is represented as a sexual break-through is actually that in reality. Many of the modern myths merely make it possible for some persons to act out their most primitive and regressive sexual impulses under the guise of being liberated at last. Still others have stayed at a very early level of development from which they view sex as a leisure-time pleasure to which they are entitled at any time or in almost any circumstances. But the primitive and the immature are hardly _reliable guides_ to healthy sexual behavior. It is about time that somebody said so before we are overwhelmed by the myth that life is just one long skin flick in which we had better take a role or lose all chance for _contentment_. (12-13)

Even in 2018, this appears reasonable to some extent, especially in today's world of sexualized social media, with online dating apps advertising how easy it might be to find casual sex whenever one wants. We're finally living in the world of the sexual revolution, and, as predicted by Kennedy, people aren't sure how to handle it. If someone becomes disillusioned with Tinder and a stream of random, unfulfilling hookups, they might begin to wonder whether their entire approach to handling sexuality is wrong. Kennedy would see this as an important moment for growth, and a moment when religion _could_ take the reins and provide better advice for people who aren't sure what they should do.

Thus, Kennedy attempts to investigate some of the concepts within the sphere of sexuality that he sees as potentially damaging without resorting to the sorts of rigid platitudes that drove a generation away from religious mythology. His goal is to understand what a psychologically and holistically healthier approach might look like, explained in a reasoned manner that might resonate with an individual confused about today's sexual environment. Let's see what he has to say.
