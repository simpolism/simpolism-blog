# On Some Possibilities for Life as an MMO

> The _problem_ isnâ€™t that gamers believe the digital worlds of their video games appear to be better than the "real world," rather _the problem_ (which represents, perhaps the one true crisis of our age) is that, for many of them, these digital worlds, objectively, _are_ better.

(From [Autistic Mercury's _The Void_](https://web.archive.org/web/20171102084549/http://www.autisticmercury.com/the-void-toronto.html))

Video games are where we go to live our lives. As commodities, they are subject to supply and demand: supply is high, but so is demand. Competition is intense, market forces molding video games into an ideal form, their universal laws arranged in the most satisfying ways possible. The evolutionary force of capitalism has turned the lowly arcade cabinet into a self-contained world: the MMORPG.

Seen as the pinnacle of addictiveness, the MMORPG serves to satisfy its players along all possible dimension. They have become increasingly good at this; rather than considering how we might improve on the MMORPG, perhaps we should look to them as a guide to living. The idea of MMORPGs as a metaphor for life has already been explored, jokingly, on Reddit's /r/outside subreddit, but rarely do you see anything resembling a formal model.

In this essay, I will use the MMORPG as a metaphor for life, with the intent of illuminating the sorts of experiences that human beings tend to find worthwhile. The result is a sort of ethical framework, a reasonable depiction of what humans want.

## Theories of Play

What's fun about games? First we might look to the tenured [_Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types_](http://mud.co.uk/richard/selfware.htm) as a guide.

Based on play styles in 1980s MUDs, Bartle's Taxonomy involves four distinct "types" of players: **Killers**, **Achievers**, **Socializers**, and **Explorers**. He plots these on the 2-by-2 in terms of whether the player enjoys _Acting_ vs _Interacting_ and _Players_ vs _Worlds_.

![Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types]()

How might we explain these axes? Baron-Cohen's ["empathizing-systemizing theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theory) seems to parallel _Players_ vs _Worlds_, while _Acting_ vs _Interacting_ seems related to competitiveness. Nonetheless, while this is a useful and straightforward model for game design and a fun personality quiz, it is unable to describe the appeal of all games, for example puzzle games, or simulation games such as Nintendogs?

Building on Bartle's Taxonomy and on 20 years of improvements in gaming technology comes Nick Yee's [_Motivations of Play in MMORPGs: Results from a Factor Analytic Approach (2005)_](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/motivations.pdf). The study asked MMORPG gamers a series of questions designed to understand their motivations for playing, based on prior, more open-ended assessments to suss out the full range of motives. After factor analysis, Yee found the following motivational categories:

![Yee's Motivations of Play](https://i.imgur.com/q4QnSzr.png)

Each person possesses these motivations in varying quantities, typically along a normal distribution with some differences based on gender. By rephrasing the descriptions in Yee's paper, I'll briefly summarize each type of motivation as they might work in "real life".

### Achievement

The **Advancement** motivation seeks to reach goals and accumulate resources. This often involves making progress: skill development, social recognition, or financial/industrial superiority. High scorers are typically drawn to serious, hard-core careers or communities that can facilitate their development.

The **Mechanics** motivation seeks to analyzing and understanding the mechanisms of various systems. The goal in understanding systems is typically to facilitate optimization within a particular domain.

The **Competition** motivation seeks the rush and experience of competing with other people. This includes both fair, constrained challenges as well as unprovoked acts. People who score high on this motive enjoy the power of winning or performing better than others.

### Social

The **Socializing** motivation seeks to meet and get to know other people. This includes chit-chat and gossip with others as well as helping out others in general. People who score high on this motive are typically drawn to casual, friendly communities.

The **Relationship** motivation seeks to form sustained, meaningful relationships with others. This includes seeking out close friends when they need support and giving support when others are dealing with crises or problems.

The **Teamwork** motivation seeks to work and collaborate with others. People who score high on this motive would rather work in a group than alone, and derive more satisfaction from group achievements than from individual achievements. People who score low prefer to work solo and find it very important to avoid relying on others.

### Immersion

The **Discovery** motivation seeks to explore and discover new things. This includes traveling just to see different parts of the world, or collecting information or items that few others have.

The **Role-Playing** motivation seeks immersion within a story. This typically involves understanding some amount of history and integrating oneself into a larger ongoing narrative.

The **Customization** motivation seeks to manipulate appearances or identity. This often involves developing a unique style.

The **Escapism** motivation seeks to relax and relieve stress away from one's other activities. This might involve physical pleasure or entertainment.

## Life As Play

Far from being MMORPG-specific, I argue that the reason we choose to engage in any activity can be explained in terms of the above ten motivations. All actions are attempts to satisfy at least one of these core motives, or else to meet our biological needs. The satisfied person engages in activities that satisfy the correct balance of motivations, as suits their nature.

So, how can we relate this to what's already known about motivation and satisfaction?

The most obvious step is to look at [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), as expressed in his paper [_A Theory of Human Motivation_ (1943)](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm). Yee's _Motivations_ points strictly to motivesthat relate to Maslow's upper three stages of **Love and Belonging**, **Esteem**, and **Self-Actualization**, without reference to **Safety** or **Physiological** needs. This makes sense, as video games cannot provide feed you nor can they protect you. However, Maslow claims that society by default already provides these needs:

> The peaceful, smoothly [p. 379] running, 'good' society ordinarily makes its members feel safe enough from wild animals, extremes of temperature, criminals, assault and murder, tyranny, etc. Therefore, in a very real sense, he no longer has any safety needs as active motivators.

Thus, we can argue that Yee's _Motivations_ provides a more nuanced description of what humans need in a modern, civilized society. Unfortunately, Maslow devotes precious little time to exploring what "self-actualization" might entail, claiming that "it remains a challenging problem for research." To dive deeper into these "higher level" needs, we might instead look at work evaluating "happiness".

Bryson & MacKerron's [_Are You Happy While You Work?_ (2017)](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/1034/happiness_study_by_lse.pdf?1410238913) can provide insight. The study used data from a [smartphone app](https://www.mappinessapp.com/) that randomly samples users' activities alongside their momentary well-being, as measured in terms of three factors: happiness, relaxation, and awakeness. Although biased toward British adults, the resulting data provides insight into the activities that people do and how they're feeling while they do them. The following table summarizes their findings:

![Bryson & MacKerron Happiness Study]()

Working with Yee's _Motivations_, the most "happy" activities tend to especially fall into the categories of **Competition**, **Socializing**, **Relationship**, **Teamwork**, **Discovery**, and **Escapism**. We can view an activity like Theatre through this lens: it's about Discovery (having a new experience), Socializing or Relationship (sharing with your theater-goers), Escapism (immersion into the show), and perhaps even Customization or Role-Playing depending on how you incorporate theater performances into your identity. Each happiness-granting activity touches on many motives in this manner.

But, some of these activites don't make us happy, yet we do them anyway. Why might we be motivated to do activities that make us unhappy? Yee's _Motivations_ can provide insight. Let's break down a meaningful but unhappy activity such as studying. Studying involves Advancement (helps develop skills that feed self-worth), Mechanics (helps you understand the material), Competition (helps you perform better than others), Role-Playing (helps you define yourself as a good student), and if you're an advanced student, Escapism. Thus, we might describe studying as a satisfying activity, even though it does not make us happy.

This idea of "satisfaction" seems to relate to both activities that make us happy, and also activities that make us unhappy. Kevin Simler's essay ["A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning"](http://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/) attempts to define satisfiction, claiming that:

> Life satisfaction = pleasure + meaning

And noting that pleasure is defined as "health, comfort, and all manner of enjoyable sensory, aesthetic, and cognitive experiences, along with the absence of pain, misery, and suffering". This seems to relate to what we saw in Bryson & MacKerron's study: we do some activities because they make us feel pleasure or happiness, while we do others because they are meaningful.

Taking another approach to the idea of a "meaningful" activity and pulling from Buddhist thought, David Chapman's ["Meaningness"](https://meaningness.com/fluidity-preview) describes "play" as one of the key components of meaning. According to Chapman, the future mode of meaning should be "collaborative, creative, improvised, intimate, transient, beautiful, **playful**, and spiritual". This idea of "life as play" or "life as a game" crops up in many cultural contexts, validating our initial decision to explore the _Motivations of Play_ as a metaphor for life.

## Play As Ethics

Can we take this metaphor further, set our sights higher?

Jeremy Bentham, the founder of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), described utility as the sum of all pleasure that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action, and claims that the best action is one that maximizes utility. Much effort and words have been spent on precisely defining suffering, what kinds exist and whether it applies to animals, but comparitively little on "pleasure". I argue that within an ethical hedonist such as Betham's, Yee's _Motivations_ provides a definition of "pleasure": it encapsulates the _positive_ aspects of utility.

What is ethical hedonism and why might we care about it? TODO: write about this, death of religion as an ethical motivating factor, etc, etc.
