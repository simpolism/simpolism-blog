# On Some Possibilities for Life as an MMO

> The _problem_ isn’t that gamers believe the digital worlds of their video games appear to be better than the “real world,” rather _the problem_ (which represents, perhaps the one true crisis of our age) is that, for many of them, these digital worlds, objectively, _are_ better.

(From [Autistic Mercury's _The Void_](https://web.archive.org/web/20171102084549/http://www.autisticmercury.com/the-void-toronto.html))

What happens when capitalism, with its simple laws of supply and demand, hits the mostly unregulated video game market? An arms race to creating the best most compelling virtual world possible. The quasi-evolutionary processes of capitalism have optimized games to become as "addictive" as possible in as many ways as possible. The result of video games replacing life is that video games must become life: video games now provide a clear picture of _what people want out of life_.

MMORPGs in particular are seen as the most addictive form of video game. Thus, games such as World of Warcraft are also likely the best at consistently living up to the desires of their players. The idea of MMORPGs as a metaphor for life has already been explored, jokingly, on Reddit's /r/outside subreddit, but rarely do you see anything resembling a formal model.

In this essay, I will use the MMORPG as a metaphor for life, with the intent of illuminating the sorts of experiences that humans in general find worthwhile. The result is a sort of ethical framework, or at least a reasonably depiction of what humans want out of life.

## Theories of Play

What's fun about games? First we might look to [Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types](http://mud.co.uk/richard/selfware.htm) as a guide.

Based on play styles in 1980s MUDs, Bartle's Taxonomy involves four distinct "types" of players: **Killers**, **Achievers**, **Socializers**, and **Explorers**. He plots these on the 2-by-2 in terms of whether the player enjoys _Acting_ vs _Interacting_ and _Players_ vs _Worlds_.

![Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types]()

Baron-Cohen's ["empathizing-systemizing theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theory) seems to parallel _Players_ vs _Worlds_, while _Acting_ vs _Interacting_ seems related to competitiveness. Nonetheless, while this is a useful and straightforward model for game design and a fun personality quiz, it seems unable to describe the appeal of all games, for example puzzle games, or simulation games such as Nintendogs?

Building on Bartle's Taxonomy and on 20 years of improvements in gaming technology comes Nick Yee's [Motivations of Play in MMORPGs: Results from a Factor Analytic Approach (2005)](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/motivations.pdf). The study asked MMORPG gamers a series of questions designed to understand their motivations for playing, based on prior, more open-ended assessments to suss out the full range of motives. After performing factor analysis, Yee finds the following motivational categories:

![Yee's Motivations of Play](https://i.imgur.com/q4QnSzr.png)

I'll briefly summarize each type of motivation as they might work in "real life" by rephrasing the descriptions in Yee's paper.

### Achievement

The **Advancement** motive involves satisfaction from reaching goals and accumulating resources. This often involves making progress: skill development, social recognition, or financial/industrial superiority. High scorers are typically drawn to serious, hard-core careers or communities that can facilitate their development.

The **Mechanics** motive involves satisfaction from analyzing and understanding the mechanisms of various systems. The goal in understanding systems is typically to facilitate optimization within a particular domain.

The **Competition** motive involves satisfaction from the rush and experience of competing with other people. This includes both fair, constrained challenges as well as unprovoked acts. People who score high on this motive enjoy the power of winning or performing better than others.

### Social

The **Socializing** motive involves satisfaction from meeting and getting to know other people. This includes chit-chat and gossip with others as well as helping out others in general. People who score high on this motive are typically drawn to casual, friendly communities.

The **Relationship** motive involves satisfaction form sustained, meaningful relationships with others. This includes seeking out close friends when they need support and giving support when others are dealing with crises or problems.

The **Teamwork** motive involves satisfaction from working and collaborating with others. People who score high on this motive would rather work in a group than alone, and derive more satisfaction from group achievements than from individual achievements. People who score low prefer to work solo and find it very important to avoid relying on others.

### Immersion

The **Discovery** motive involves satisfaction from exploring and discovering new things. This includes traveling just to see different parts of the world, or collecting information or items that few others have.

The **Role-Playing** motive involves satisfaction from being immersed in a story. This typically involves understanding some amount of history and integrating oneself into a larger ongoing narrative.

The **Customization** motive involves satisfaction from manipulating their appearance or identity. This often involves developing a unique style or appearance.

The **Escapism** motive involves satisfaction from relaxation or stress relief apart from one's other activities. This might involve physical pleasure or entertainment.

## Life As Play

Far from being MMORPG-specific, I argue that the reason we choose to engage in any activity can be explained in terms of the above ten motives. All actions are attempts to satisfy at least one of these core motives, or else to meet our biological needs. The satisfied life would be one with the correct balance of the above motivations, as suits one's nature.

So, what do we already know about life satisfaction? How do people spend their leisure time, and how effective are each of the activities they choose? And how might these relate to the above categories?

Kevin Simler's ["A Nihilist's Guide To Meaning"](http://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/) suggests the following formula for evaluating satisfaction:

> Life satisfaction = pleasure + meaning

Thus, we must explore how each of the above activties relates to either pleasure or meaning. Note that Simler's definition of "pleasure" is "health, comfort, and all manner of enjoyable sensory, aesthetic, and cognitive experiences, along with the absence of pain, misery, and suffering". This definition of pleasure seems equivalent to the idea of "momentary well-being", which is explored in [a paper by Bryson & MacKerron](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/1034/happiness_study_by_lse.pdf?1410238913).

The paper uses data from a [smartphone app](https://www.mappinessapp.com/) that randomly samples users' activities alongside their momentary well-being, as measured in terms of three factors: happiness, relaxation, and awakeness. Although biased toward British adults, the resulting data provides insight into the kinds of activities that provide pleasure. The following table summarizes their findings:

![Bryson & MacKerron Happiness Study]()

This provides a rough guide as to the sorts of leisure activities that appeal to most people, but it doesn't provide us with a deep understanding of why these particular activities appeal. It also fails to answer the question of which activities people might find meaningful, even if they aren't happy or relaxed while performing the activity. We might describe these activities on the whole as "pleasure".

Using Yee's framework, the most "happy" activities tend to especially fall into the categories of **Competition**, **Socializing**, **Relationship**, **Teamwork**, **Discovery**, and **Escapism**. We can view an activity like Theatre through this lens: it's about Discovery (having a new experience), Socializing or Relationship (sharing with your theater-goers), Escapism (immersion into the show), and perhaps even Customization or Role-Playing depending on how you incorporate theater performances into your identity. Each happiness-granting activity touches on many motives in this manner.

But, we still do some activities that don't make us happy. These activities must therefore involve motives other than happiness. Drawing from Simler, this must be instead draw on the idea of "meaningful".

The question of which activities are meaningful as opposed to "happiness-generating" is somewhat contested. To take one possible path, in her essay ["Meaning and Pointing"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/10/01/meaning-and-pointing/), Saray Perry cites Baumeister's research, writing:

> Roy Baumeister (Meanings of Life, 1991) proposes that humans have four basic needs for meaning: a need for an **ultimate value base**, a need for personal **purpose**, a need for **self-worth or status**, and a need for **efficacy or control**.

In terms of Yee's framework, **ultimate value base** maps roughly to **Customization**, **purpose** roughly to **Role-Playing**, **self-worth or status** to **Advancement**, and **efficacy or control** to **Mechanics**. We can break down an activity such as studying, which seems to make people un-happy, as potentially being about: Advancement (helps develop skills), Mechanics (helps you understand the material), Competition (helps you perform better than others), Role-Playing (helps you define yourself as a good student), and if you're an advanced student, Escapism.

Taking an alternative approach and pulling from Buddhist thought, David Chapman's ["Meaningness"](https://meaningness.com/fluidity-preview) describes "play" as one of the key components of meaning in a world reeling from the death of God and the end of Modernism. According to Chapman, the future mode of meaning should be "collaborative, creative, improvised, intimate, transient, beautiful, **playful**, and spiritual". This idea of "life as play" or "life as a game" crops up across a variety of cultural contexts: perhaps understanding the _Motivations of Play_ can illuminate the motivations driving our lives.

## Play As Ethics

Jeremy Bentham, the founder of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), described utility as the sum of all pleasure that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action. Much effort and words have been spent on precisely defining suffering, but comparitively few on "pleasure". I argue that within an ethical hedonist framework, Yee's taxonomy of motivation provides a strong model for what "pleasure" means: it defines the _positive_ aspect of utility.

Phrased differently, when thinking about how we might want to better the world, Yee's taxonomy tells us what sorts of experiences we might want to build and bring to people. It can also serve as a guide in our own lives, pointing to areas where we might be unsatisfied, and helping us pick activities that'll ultimately make us feel better.

One way to think about this involves picking any one category and considering ways to bring people more of it. For example, if you cared a lot about giving people more opportunities to satisfy their desire for Relationships, you might decide to build an online dating app. Or if you wanted to help people with Customization and exploring their identity, you might become a fashion designer or work in advertising.

When thinking ethically, it's important to note that Yee's framework does not contain _all_ needs humans require. In terms of [Maslow's Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), Yee's framework points strictly to motives relating to the top three stages of **Love and Belonging**, **Esteem**, and **Self-Actualization**, and not to **Safety** or **Physiological** needs. But we must ask: would life truly be worth living if deprived of all such satisfactions? I expect most would answer "No."
