# On Some Possibilities for Life as an MMO

From [Autistic Mercury's _The Void_](https://web.archive.org/web/20171102084549/http://www.autisticmercury.com/the-void-toronto.html):

> The _problem_ isn’t that gamers believe the digital worlds of their video games appear to be better than the “real world,” rather _the problem_ (which represents, perhaps the one true crisis of our age) is that, for many of them, these digital worlds, objectively, _are_ better.

What happens when capitalism, with its simple laws of supply and demand, hits the mostly unregulated video game market? An arms race to creating the best most compelling virtual world possible. The quasi-evolutionary processes of capitalism have optimized games to become as "addictive" as possible in as many ways as possible. The result of video games replacing life is that video games must become life: video games now provide a clear picture of _what people want out of life_.

MMORPGs in particular are seen as the most addictive form of video game. Thus, games such as World of Warcraft are also likely the best at consistently living up to the desires of their players. The idea of MMORPGs as a metaphor for life has already been explored, jokingly, on Reddit's /r/outside subreddit, but rarely do you see anything resembling a formal model.

In this essay, I will use the MMORPG as a metaphor for life, with the intent of illuminating the sorts of experiences that humans in general find worthwhile. The result is a sort of ethical framework: if we know _The Things That Humans Want_, we can then plausibly claim that the _Good_ is whatever enables as many people as possible to have as much of these things as possible. Whether this explicitly involves video games is still up for debate.

## On Fun and Life

What do we already know about how to live life and have fun? How do people spend their leisure time, and how effective are each of the activities they choose?

[A paper by Bryson & MacKerron](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/1034/happiness_study_by_lse.pdf?1410238913) empirically explores happiness and relaxation by using data from a [smartphone app](https://www.mappinessapp.com/). Although biased toward British adults, the resulting data is interesting. The following table summarizes their findings:

This provides a rough guide as to the sorts of leisure activities that appeal to most people, but it doesn't provide us with a deep understanding of why these particular activities appeal. It also fails to answer the question of which activities people might find meaningful, even if they aren't happy or relaxed while performing the activity. We might describe these activities on the whole as "pleasure".

The question of which activities are meaningful as opposed happiness-generating is both hotly contested and blindingly obvious to most people. To take one possible path, in her essay ["Meaning and Pointing"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/10/01/meaning-and-pointing/), Saray Perry cites Baumeister's research, and writes:

> Roy Baumeister (Meanings of Life, 1991) proposes that humans have four basic needs for meaning: a need for an **ultimate value base**, a need for personal **purpose**, a need for **self-worth or status**, and a need for **efficacy or control**.

Perry elaborates on each using a metaphor for geographic navigation, and gives us some ideas of what sorts of endeavors might be meaningful. We will return to these later.

To tie these ideas together, Kevin Simler's ["A Nihilist's Guide To Meaning"](http://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/) suggests the following formula for evaluating one's life satisfaction:

> Life satisfaction = pleasure + meaning

Through the rest of this essay, I will argue that MMORPGs contain the components required to simulate every aspect of life satisfaction, including both pleasure and meaning. However, this does not mean that MMORPGs are currently effective substitutes for real life. Drawing from Nozick's "experience machine", Simler writes:

> a life in the machine has no meaning, at least from the perspective of someone standing outside it. To choose the tank would be to render your real life a causal dead-end; you'd become as irrelevant as a brain-dead patient on life support.

This objection holds water, but we might still want to learn from the simulation to try and better our non-simulated lives. (TODO: rewrite this with a cuter metaphor, a mirror perhaps?)

## Theories of Game Fun

What's fun about games? First we might look to [Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types](http://mud.co.uk/richard/selfware.htm) as a guide. Although revealing, this is not empirically supported.

TODO: explain Bartle

Nick Yee's [Motivations of Play in MMORPGs](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/motivations.pdf) is a study done on gamers that builds on Bartle's ideas and provides us the sort of framework we're looking for. See below.

Far from seeming like an MMORPG-only guide, this seems like a fully-fledged framework for understanding the full spectrum of activities people want out of life, although individuals might differ on the relative quantities of each. Effectively, it proves us a meta-ethical framework, that allows you to weight the things you find Good at any time. Let us examine each category and the various reasons referenced by players to see how it might relate to our broader lives.

### Achievement

> While many players describe a desire to achieve in the game, there appear to be two different threads of where the satisfaction lies. One group of players derive satisfaction from the constant progress offered by the game mechanisms, while the other group of players are driven mainly to reach a goal

> The Grind, Goal Driven, Power brings Recognition, Competition, Self-Sufficiency, Optimization

### Social

> The Ultimate Chatroom, Forming Relationships, A Helping Hand, Playing with RL Friends/Family, The Guild, Teamwork, As Therapy/Outlet

### Immersion

> My Story, The Story of the World, Quests, Role-Playing, Identity Exploration, Exploring, Discovery, Knowledge, Fantasy, Escapism

### Other Motives

> Nurturance, Making A Difference, The Search for Self, The Search for Youth
