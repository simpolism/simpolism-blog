# On Some Possibilities for Life as an MMO

Why do people play video games? Because they're fun. As the Most Fun Technology Yet Developed, video game design is best positioned to provide us insight into what humans find "fun". In particular, the most fun form of video game is the MMORPG: why else would it create the most shrill cries of "addiction"? The idea of MMORPGs as a metaphor for life has already been explored, jokingly, on Reddit's /r/outside subreddit, but rarely do you see anything resembling a formal model. In this essay, I will use the MMORPG as a metaphor for life, with the intent of illuminating the sorts of things that humans in general find worthwhile.

## On Fun and Life

What do we already know about how to live life and have fun?

Review Sarah Perry's [Body Pleasure](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/) (but pleasure is not enough!) and [Life as a Joke](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/01/07/on-some-possibilities-for-life-as-a-joke/) (good ideas but we want to go in another direction). Review study on [happiness](https://twitter.com/DegenRolf/status/960863675883098112) (but happiness is not enough!).

## Games and Fun

Why do people play games? Or MMORPGs? First we might look to [Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types](http://mud.co.uk/richard/selfware.htm) as a guide. Although revealing, this is not empirically supported. Nick Yee's [Motivations of Play in MMORPGs](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/motivations.pdf) is a study done on gamers that builds on Bartle's ideas and provides us the sort of framework we're looking for. See below.

Far from seeming like an MMORPG-only guide, this seems like a fully-fledged framework for understanding the full spectrum of activities people want out of life, although individuals might differ on the relative quantities of each. Effectively, it proves us a meta-ethical framework, that allows you to weight the things you find Good at any time. Let us examine each category and the various reasons referenced by players to see how it might relate to our broader lives.

### Achievement

> While many players describe a desire to achieve in the game, there appear to be two different threads of where the satisfaction lies. One group of players derive satisfaction from the constant progress offered by the game mechanisms, while the other group of players are driven mainly to reach a goal

> The Grind, Goal Driven, Power brings Recognition, Competition, Self-Sufficiency, Optimization
