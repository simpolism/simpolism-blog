In [_The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_](https://www.are.na/block/2554290), Julian Jaynes puts forth four separable hypotheses<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>:

1. [_Consciousness is based on language._](#consciousness)
2. [_The bicameral mind._](#bicamerality)
3. [_The dating._](#dating)
4. [_The double brain._](#brain)

I intend to describe each of these in turn, providing detail proportional to the degree in which I'm interested in each of the claims. 

### <a name="consciousness">1. Consciousness is based on language.</a>

#### What is consciousness?

Before discussing "the bicameral mind", the reader must first understand Jaynes' definition of consciousness<sup>[2](#f2)</sup>. He provides the following definition (all emphasis mine):

> **Subjective conscious mind \[or, "consciousness",\] is an analog of what is called the real world**. It is built up with a vocabulary or lexical field whose terms are all metaphors or analogs of behavior in the physical world. Its reality is of the same order as mathematics. It allows us to shortcut behavioral processes and arrive at more adequate decisions. Like mathematics, it is an operator rather than a thing or repository. And it is intimately bound up with volition and decision. (55)

This definition rests on a specific conception of the term "analog":

> An analog is a model, but a model of a special kind. It is not like a scientific model, whose source may be anything at all and whose purpose is to act as an hypothesis of explanation or understanding. Instead, **an analog is at every point generated by the thing it is an analog of**. A map is a good example. It is not a model in the scientific sense... Instead, it is constructed from something well known, if not completely known. Each region of a district of land is allotted a corresponding region on the map, though the materials of land and map are absolutely different and a large proportion of the features of the land have to be left out. And **the relation between an analog map and its land is a metaphor**. If I point to a location on a map and say, "There is Mont Blanc and from Chamonix we can reach the east face this way," that is really a shorthand way of saying, "The relations between the point labeled 'Mont Blanc' and other points is similar to the actual Mont Blanc and its neighboring regions." (54)

It also rests on Jaynes' definition of metaphor:

> I am using metaphor here in its most general sense: the use of a term for one thing to describe another beacuse of some kind of similarity between them or between their relations to other things. There are thus always two terms in a metaphor, the thing to be described, which I shall call the _metaphrand_, and the thing or relation used to elucidate it, which I shall call the _metaphier_. A metaphor is always a known metaphier operating on a less known metaphrand. I have coined these hybrid terms simply to echo muliplication where a multiplier operates on a multiplicand. (48-49)

> If we look more carefully at the nature of metaphor (noticing all the while the metaphorical nature of almost everything we are saying), we find (even the verb "find"!) that it is composed of more than a metaphier and a metaphrand. There are also at the bottom of the most complex metaphors various associations or attributes of the metaphier which I am going to call _paraphiers_. And these paraphiers project back into the metaphrand as what I shall call _paraphrands_ of the metaphrand. (56)

This is a challenging set of relations at first glance. If interested in developing a deeper understanding of metaphor, check out my (currently TBD) post on metaphor. It might provide more intuition into the relations Jaynes describes.

From this concept of metaphor, Jaynes arrives at a definition of "understanding":

> Like children trying to describe nonsense objects, so in trying to understand a thing we are trying to find a metaphor for that thing. Not just any metaphor, but one with something more familiar and easy to our attention. Understanding a thing is to arrive at a metaphor for that thing by substituting something more familiar to us. And the feeling of familiarity is the feeling of understanding. (52)

And finally, Jaynes elaborates fully on the definition of consciousness, using his descriptions of metaphor:

> ...consciousness is the work of lexical metaphor. It is spun out of the concrete metaphiers of expression and their paraphiers, projecting paraphrands that exist only in the functional sense. Moreover, it goes on generating itself, each new paraphrand capable of being a metaphrand on its own, resulting in new metaphiers with their paraphiers, and so on. (58)

#### What are the features of consciousness?

Given this definition of consciousness as "a lexical analog or map of the real world", how is consciousness used? Jaynes identifies six key features:

1. Spatialization
2. Excerption
3. The Analog "I"
4. The Metaphor "Me"
5. Narratization
6. Conciliation

<a name="f2">2</a>: In the "Afterword", Jaynes elaborates on what consciousness is _not_, addressing some confusions:

> The most common error which I did not emphasize sufficiently is to confuse consciousness with perception... This type of confusion was at least encouraged back in 1921 by Bertrand RUssell: "We are conscious of anything that we perceive." And as his logical atomism because fashionable in philosophy, it became difficult to see it any other way. And in a later book Russell uses an example of consciousness "I see a table." But Descartes, who gave us the modern idea of consciousness, would never have agreed. Nor would a radical behaviorist like Watson, who in denying consciousness existed certainly did not mean sense perception.

> Just as in the case I mentioned above, I suggest Russell was not being conscious of the table, but of the argument he was writing about. In my own notation, I would diagram the situation as:

> 'I' --> (I see a table).

> Russell thought his consciousness was the second term, but in reality it was the entire expression.
