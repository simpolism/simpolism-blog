## I.

Let us take a stance: _man's primary mode of thought is the narrative_. What might this mean? What implications might this have?

First: what is a narrative? A narrative is a _linear chain of events_ that connect to form a _causal structure_, such that earlier events in the narrative necessarily lead to later ones. This causal structure might be complicated, and the narrative might not be linear in time -- a given conclusion might only be reached by considering several simultaneous events -- but the causal structure is always "moving forward" temporally. For example, you might need to know the simultaneous events of my morning and events of the train system to provide a causal structure explaining why I'm late to work.

This can be diagrammed in two ways: linearly and in terms of causality. Let "M" be "my morning", "T" be "the train system", and "L" be "late to work".

Linear structure, how the story is told: M -> T -> L

Causal structure, how the events are justified: M + T = L

Let us assume most of human thought, as an analogue to oral storytelling, operates as such: we create a causal structure and explain it linearly.

As an aside, we might consider "rationality" as "the art of building convincing justifications for a given causal structure", and "science" as the practice of constraining the space of possible causal events to reproducible, empirical observations. "Mathematics" --??

## II.

Now, let us apply this structure to one of our most essential narratives: ourselves.

Humans spend a lot of time figuring out how to tell the story of themselves. We build ourselves a _personal narrative_ that relates events from our past and childhood to our present self. This is common in psychological literature: I was _traumatized_ at age 3 by a viscious goose, _and now_ water fowl and phallic shapes cause me distress. Traumatic events were formative and had undesirable results on your self. Common.

What happens when we project our personal narratives into the future? We act based on predictions of outcomes: we imagine several causal structures and then decide how to act. "Meaning" is the feeling that our chosen actions relate to our broader personal narrative: a meaningful action crystallizes another event in your personal narrative. "Freedom" is the feeling that we have meaningful choices available.

The result: people feel free when they are able to take meaningful action. Conversely, people cannot take meaningful action when they feel that they have no choices. A concrete application of this involves genetics: if your life outcome is determined at birth, then your actions are not meaningful. You are not free, you are bound by the chains of your inheritance. Interestingly, "identity" also falls into this trap: if you feel that your life is deeply determined by your racial or ethnic identity, your ability to construct meaningful narratives suffers. Foucault recognizes this trap in "History of Sexuality, Vol. 1" (TODO: QUOTE).
