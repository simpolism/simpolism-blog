# Locks of Desire

"Money flows like water", is a metaphor in business. Venkatesh Rao describes "ancient rivers of money"[1], cash that flows in rivers and streams, businesses built on the riversides. But what are these flows? Where do they come from and how do they shift? What really is the world this metaphor describes?

In Freud's psychoanalysis, he draws on electricity to describe one's emotional, animating energy. "Libido", he called it, is stored in the ego, and is charged into objects via a process of "cathexis"[2]. Freud saw desires as gaps left by lost satisfactions, which manifest as wishes inside of our dreams. We might see human actions as a flow of libido in attempted satisfaction of a range of desires, from the bodily pleasures of eating and sex to the complex passions of culture.

These acts of desire may seem separate from money, but scarcity connects every act. We need food for survival, and food's a scarce resource, so money is what enables us to do anything at all. We are creatures of markets; our actions reshape the terrain itself, creating the rivers and streams. And how? Let us look to the Hydrologic Cycle to understand these systems of flow[3].

We each need enough to meet our needs, a trickle of water from some source or another. Most use some libido to help a business move ground and receive a small drink in return. Or perhaps we pray for rain from the clouds of the government, formed by taxation's broad transpirations. Our trickles work their way under the ground, then slowly creep out to the sea. Those great oceans of money, the banks. Ocean clouds form by evaporation and rain upon mountainous peaks. This rain comes from loans and capital and real estate, sources of the great rivers below. Some men capture enough to form pools of their own[4], while others, unfortunately, go thirsty.

So, what do we do with our humble libidos? Those at the top use energy to move others: they lead corporations, coordinating power to run the great locks and canals. These man-made channels become part of the landscape, and those downstream grow to rely on their flows. Most people contribute to these giant structures, although not always at the same position in the streams. Then most use what's left to grow a few flowers, hoping for pollination and leaving behind some art.
