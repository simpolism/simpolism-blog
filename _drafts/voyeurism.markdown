## What Is Voyeurism?

Fetishes and "perversions" are common phenomena, but our understanding of the mechanics behind them are often opaque. We understand the fetishist exists, but we struggle to relate, to figure out the "why" and "how" behind their interests. The goal of this essay is to answer this question in the case of the voyeur: "What is it? What is its erotic basis? What do people like about it?"

Voyeurism is a term which has a couple of distinct colloquial meanings. I choose to define "voyeurism" as **erotic experience through direct observation**.

We can see voyeurism as the embodied cousin of porn consumption. Porn might be described as "erotic experience through observation," so perhaps we might classify porn as _a simulacra_ of voyeurism. In this essay I hope to explore the aspects more unique to voyeurism, including understanding what "voyeurism porn" might be.

To be clear, "perversion" is not derogatory in this case. It is the terminology used by Thomas Nagel in [Sexual Perversions](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc66/32ba46b9d31b0bff5285ebe8c1453513cce2.pdf) (pdf) to describe behavior that deviates from his "complete configuration" of sexual desire: "_reflexive mutual recognition_... a desire that one's partner be aroused by the recognition of one's desire that he or she is aroused." Given this definition, most voyeuristic behavior is a perversion (except perhaps the case of exhibitionism, which we will discuss later). We might then ask: _what makes voyeurism work? What kinds of erotic experience can be obtained through observation?_

I argue the following types are the most common ways in which voyeurs get off:

* _projective_ voyeurism, typically paired with fetishization of femininity
* the mutual erotic pairing of voyeurism and exhibitionism
* voyeurism as a masochistic/sadistic activity


## Projective Voyeurism

What might it mean for voyeurism to be projective? Is all porn not projective, in which you project yourself into the actor and simulate a sexual experience? If you go online and look up "voyeur porn", what you get are not videos of couples having sex, where you, the viewer, are watching, but instead another layer: you get videos designed to replicate a particular experience of observation. Perhaps "hidden camera" videos of relatively normal women in changing rooms or showering. What might the appeal of this be?

David Foster Wallace [writes](https://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf) (pdf) (emphasis mine):

> What classic voyeurism is is espial: watching people who don't know you're there as they go about the _mundane but erotically charged little businesses of private life_. It's interesting that so much classic voyeurism involves media of framed glass--windows, telescopes, etc. Maybe the framed glass is why the analogy to television is so tempting. But TV-watching is a different animal from Peeping Tomism. Because the people we're watching through TV's framed-glass screen are not really ignorant of the fact that somebody is watching them...

It is a key aspect of "voyeur porn" is a simulation of the target being unaware of the voyeur. But the more interesting part of his paragraph is the idea of "mundane but erotically charged little businesses of private life." We might wonder: what about _private life_ is _erotically charged_?

Haley Thurston provides us with an inkling of the answer, in her essay ["The Heroine's Journey"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/28/the-heroines-journey/) (emphasis mine):

> If the graceful negotiation of composure and things that threaten composure is the essence of female value, and fetishes originate in the secret and taboo, then well, of course **the destruction of female composure would become deeply, repeatedly fetishized.**

I argue Haley gets close, but doesn't go all the way: it is not necessarily _the destruction_ of female composure that is fetishized, so much as _female composure itself_. However, the essence of female composure is most easily grasped when destroyed. The true nature of a norm is made clear through its taboo.

Let us consider a voyeurism scenario. A man is watching a woman performing some "little businesses of private life." She is unaware.

Beyond her appeal as a sexual object, he might imagine her psychology, her thought processes, her sensory experience, etc. He might imagine her negotiating composure prior to finding privacy: she might have felt aroused for some reason, but couldn't act on it or reveal it. He might imagine what this reason was, and her internal negotiation between taboo, animal experience and social norms. Hence there is a deep eroticism _built into modern life_, often based in Victorian notions of composure, that rests on the tension between social norms surrounding sexuality and our base desires.

(TODO: quote Foucault? This section needs elaboration, examples? Discuss mind-reading fetish e.g.)

In this scenario, we assumed the voyeur remained hidden while observing his target. But, what happens if the target becomes aware of the voyeur? Two main outcomes exist: either the target becomes ashamed of her behavior, and reacts with fear, or she becomes aroused and engages in a sexual performance (exhibitionism). The rest of this essay will explore these two possibilities.

## The Exhibitionism Pairing

To understand the relationship between exhibitionism and voyeurism, we must also understand the root desires of the exhibitionist. The exhibitionist fantasy springs from a similar place to the voyeuristic fantasy. Instead of fetishizing the _composure_, the exhibitionist is the one fetishizing _the destruction of composure_. She acts out direct violations of social norms, ideally with knowledge that she is being observes, and derives pleasure from this.

If a typical dominant actor, often male, is active and initiating, and a typical subissive actor, often female, is passive and receptive, then we might describe the exhibitionist as _active and receptive_ and the voyeur as _passive and intiating_ (TODO: 2x2 active/passive initiating/receptive?).

Interestingly, both typically male roles are initiating and both typically female roles are receptive. Perhaps this reveals a deeper truth about sexuality and gender.

Let us analyze a monologue from Ingmar Bergman's film _Persona_ to understand the exhibitionism/voyeurism dynamic more clearly:

> We lay there completely naked and sunbathed... dozing off and on, putting sunscreen on. We had silly straw hats on. Mine had a blue ribbon. I lay there...looking out at the landscape, at the sea and the sun. It was kind of funny. Suddenly I saw two figures on the rocks above us. They hid and peeped out occasionally. "Two boys are looking at us," I said to the girl, Her name was Katarina. "Let them look," she said, and turned over on her back. I had a funny feeling. I wanted to jump up and put my suit on, but I just lay there on my stomach with my bottom in the air, unembarrassed, totally calm. And Katarina was next to me with her breasts and big thighs. She was just giggling. I noticed that the boys were coming closer. They just stood there looking at us. I noticed they were very young. The boldest one approached us...and squatted down next to Katarina. He pretended to be busy picking his toes. I felt very strange. Suddenly Katarina said to him, "Hey, you, why don't you come over here?" Then she took his hand and helped him take off his jeans and shirt. Suddenly he was on top of her...

The [monologue continues in more graphic detail](http://www.actorpoint.com/free_monologues/mvw112.html), but the most important aspects have been revealed.

(TODO: elaborate more on this) In this situation, the women are naked, in a taboo state. Katarina shows knowledge that the boys were looking at her, and the speaker realizes that the bolder boy was only "[pretending] to be busy picking his toes." The speaker then becomes aroused. The subtext is that the exhibitionists are aware that the boys are watching and desiring, and this, in turn, arouses them. Ultimately, this scenario results in sexual contact, which causes us to wonder: perhaps this situation is not perverse at all?

(TODO: refactor) Unfortunately for the enterprising voyeur, it is difficult to know whether his target will be an exhibitionist. The target's emotions are likely to be mixed between arousal and shame, and many individuals will choose to act on their feelings of shame rather than "leaning into" the arousal.

What might lead to a target feeling aroused instead of ashamed? Exhibitionism, as an active position, involves an explicit power dynamic: the exhibitionist has power over the voyeur. He desires her, and she knows it. She could report him to the authorities, or she could fulfill his desires, and he knows it. A naive voyeur presents less of a threat if he decides to overstep whatever boundaries the exhibitionist sets, thus he is more likely to provoke an exhibitionistic response. Perhaps the exhibitionist impulse ties into the mothering impulse to some degree: rather than the dominant man taking the submissive woman, the child desires his mother, and the mother wants to fulfill his desires.

## Voyeurism as S/M

As noted in the discussion of exhibitionism, there exists an explicit power dynamic between the voyeur and the exhibitionist: the latter has power over the former. To understand the possibilities for sadism and masochism in voyeurism, let us look at Nagel's discussion of sadism and masochism, which draws from Marquis De Sade:

> Sadism concentrates on the evocation of passive self-awareness in others, but the sadist's engagement is itself active and requires a retention of deliberate control which impedes awareness of himself as a bodily subject of passion in the required sense. The victim must recognize him as the source of his own sexual passivity, but only as the active source. De Sade claimed that the object of sexual desire was to evoke involuntary responses from one's partner...

> A masochist on the other hand imposes the same disability on his partner as the sadist imposes on himself. The masochist cannot find a satisfactory embodiment as the object of another's sexual desire, but only as the object of his control. He is passive not in relation to his partner's passion but in relation to his nonpassive agency...

(TODO: elaborate) Often, fantasies surrounding exhibitionism do not end with sexual contact, as the scene from _Persona_ did, and instead involve in the exhibitionist _bossing around the voyeur_ in order for him to avoid punishment, both taking pleasure in this. We might see this as a situation in which the voyeur is masochistic and the exhibitionist is sadistic.

The reverse situation also exists, seemingly less common, in which the voyeur makes his presence known to his target, and forces her to degrade herself. This is quite explicitly a sadistic scenario.

Given that sadism and masochism have been discussed at length in other literature on sexuality, I feel this topic does not require a more in-depth discussion here.

## Conclusion
