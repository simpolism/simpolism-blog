The act of voyeurism, in its most idealized form, is an asymmetric interaction between two people:
* a _voyeur_, the hidden observer, often male, and
* a _target_, the oblivious exhibit, often female

Voyeurism is asymmetric: the voyeur is hidden, yet is observing the target perform _some action_. The target's actions typically involve a _taboo_ or _dignity violation_. Haley Thurston writes, in her essay ["The Heroine's Journey"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/28/the-heroines-journey/) (emphasis mine):

> If the graceful negotiation of composure and things that threaten composure is the essence of female value, and fetishes originate in the secret and taboo, then well, of course **the destruction of female composure would become deeply, repeatedly fetishized.**

The voyeur attempts to catch the target in a moment in which her composure is compromised. The process of positioning and anticipating a target is rich with erotic tension. It is also deeply male: voyeurism is applied problem-solving, an objectification of a target for the voyeur's sexual pleasure. The target is an animal, and the voyeur is laying a trap.

Once a target is "caught", she might or might not be aware of the voyeur. This leads to different fantastical scenarios with different erotic outcomes. We can break the target's position into the following types:

1. total unawareness of the voyeur (the _hidden_ case)
2. awareness of the voyeur, accompanied by arousal and increased performativity (the _exhibition_ case)
3. awareness of the voyeur, accompanied by shame and attempted evasion (the _shame_ case)
4. awareness of some presence or otherness, but unclear of who or what (the _suspicion_ case)

To discuss these possibilites, I pull upon Thomas Nagel's [Sexual Perversions](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc66/32ba46b9d31b0bff5285ebe8c1453513cce2.pdf) (pdf), specifically his "cocktail lounge" thought experiment. Please allow me to quote Nagel at length, explaining the "normal" process of arousal in a _symmetric_ observational situation:

> Suppose a man and a woman, whom we may call Romeo and Juliet, are at opposite ends of a cocktail lounge, with many mirrors on the walls which permit unobserved observation, and even mutual unobserved observation. Each of them is sipping a martini and studying other people in the mirrors. At some point Romeo notices Juliet. He is moved, somehow, by the softness of her hair and the diffidence with which she sips her martini, and this arouses him sexually. Let us say that X senses Y whenever X regards Y with sexual desire. (Y need not be a person, and X's apprehension of Y can be visual, tactile, olfactory, etc., or purely imaginary; in the present example we shall concentrate on vision.)

> So Romeo senses Juliet, rather than merely noticing her. At this stage he is aroused by an unaroused object, so he is more in the sexual grip of his body than she of hers.

Here we see the _hidden_ case as described above: the voyeur is aware of the target, but she is not aware of him. We might visualize this as follows: ![hidden voyeur case]({{ site.url }}/assets/voyeurism/arousal_hidden.jpg)

Were the target merely an object, this would correspond to one of Nagel's pathological cases: "If the object is not alive, the experience is reduced entirely to an awareness of one's own sexual embodiment." But the target is a person, and her position exposes a key aspect of voyeurism: anxiety. The voyeur is at risk of exposing his position, with potentially disastrious consequences, especially considering the illegal and socially unacceptable status of the voyeuristic act. Anxiety and the erotic go hand-in-hand, and in voyeurism the anxiety runs deep.

These consequences perhaps are inseparable from the eroticism of the action. The degredation of composure is only fetishized because it holds such import in society. Voyeurism is a "rights violation", it is a violation of privacy rather than how, say, rape is a violation of physical autonomy. As expressed by the popularity of fantasy novels such as _50 Shades of Grey_, taboos create fantasies, and voyeurism is another expression of this dynamic. The flip side of taboo fantasies is that the fantasy disappears if the taboo dissolves: if the target no longer expects privacy, voyeurism loses its appeal.

Further possibilities emerge as more symmetric knowledge is gained:

> Let us suppose, however, that Juliet now senses Romeo in another mirror on the opposite wall, though neither of them yet knows that he is seen by the other (the mirror angles provide three-quarter views). Romeo then begins to notice in Juliet the subtle signs of sexual arousal: heavy-lidded stare, dilating pupils, faint flush, et cetera. This of course renders her much more bodily, and he not only notices but senses this as well. His arousal is nevertheless still solitary. But now, cleverly calculating the line of her stare without actually looking her in the eyes, he realizes that it is directed at him through the mirror on the opposite wall. That is, he notices, and moreover senses, Juliet sensing him. This is definitely a new development, for it gives him a sense of embodiment not only through his own reactions but through the eyes and reactions of another. Moreover, it is separable from the initial sensing of Juliet; for sexual arousal might begin with a person's sensing that he is sensed and being assailed by the perception of the other person's desire rather than merely by the perception of the person.

> But there is a further step. Let us suppose that Juliet, who is a little slower than Romeo, now senses that he senses her. This puts Romeo in a position to notice, and be aroused by, her arousal at being sensed by him. He senses that she senses that he senses her. This is still another level of arousal, for he becomes conscious of his sexuality through his awareness of its effect on her and of her awareness that this effect is due to him. Once she takes the same step and senses that he senses her sensing him, it becomes difficult to state, let alone imagine, further iterations, though they may be logically distinct. If both are alone, they will presumably turn to look at each other directly, and the proceedings will continue on another plane. Physical contact and intercourse are perfectly natural extensions of this complicated visual exchange, and mutual touch can involve all the complexities of awareness present in the visual case, but with a far greater range of subtlety and acuteness.

We might visualize this "normal" encounter as follows: ![Nagel's cocktail party]({{ site.url }}/assets/voyeurism/arousal_nagel.jpg)

The voyeuristic encounter diverges from Nagel's idealized account in one specific detail (emphasis mine): "sexual arousal might begin with a person's sensing that he is sensed and being assailed by the perception of _the other person's desire_ rather than merely by the perception of the person". In an _exhbition_ situation, the voyeur is physically aware of the target, but the target's desire is _formless_: the target does not _desire_ the voyeur, as a body or as a whole person, she instead desires exhibition, _to be seen_, with the voyeur validating this fantasy.

Both the voyeur and the exhibitionist-target are playing with fantasies. In her awareness of being observed, the exhibitionist is having her fantasy fulfilled. By acting plausibly as if she were unaware of the voyeur, the exhbitionist fulfills the voyeur's fantasy. But by tacitly ackowledging her awareness, the voyeur _knows that the target knows_, and this dramatically heightens his arousal.

Often, this ends the explicit reciprocal chain, as there is no way for the exhibitionist to tell that the voyeur is "getting her hints" without ability to observe his behavior. However, this can continue through fantasy, as the voyeur imagines the exhibitionist's thoughts and embodiment and she imagines his. Some erotic literature bridges this gap explictly, by having the exhibitionist sense proxies for arousal such as heavier breathing, but these signs can be so subtle that their ability to signal reciprocation is limited. We might visualize this encouter as follows: ![exhibitionist case]({{ site.url }}/assets/voyeurism/arousal_exhibitionist.jpg)

Exhibitionism is perhaps the most ideal situation, the closest to what Nagel calls "the basic framework of any full-fledged sexual relation". It is reciprocated to a large degree and involves mutual fulfillment of fantasy.

In a _shame_ situation, in which the voyeur obtains pleasure from the target's distress, can be likened to Nagel's discussion of sadism:

> Sadism concentrates on the evocation of passive self-awareness in others, but the sadist's engagement is itself active and requires a retention of deliberate control which impedes awareness of himself as a bodily subject of passion in the required sense. The victim must recognize him as the source of his own sexual passivity, but only as the active source. De Sade claimed that the object of sexual desire was to evoke involuntary responses from one's partner, especially audible ones. The infliction of pain is no doubt the most efficient way to accomplish this...

In a voyeuristic scenario, this physical pain is replaced by _intimate knowledge_, an intrusion into the target's sphere of assumed privacy. The voyeur causes the target to act out of shame, thus demonstrating his power over her and satisfying De Sade's criterion. We might visualize this as follows: ![sadist case]({{ site.url }}/assets/voyeurism/arousal_shame.jpg)

To complete our case-by-case analysis, the _suspicion_ case straddles the line between hidden and shame. The target is aware _something_ is amiss, thus the voyeur has managed to evoke an involuntary response, yet it is insufficient to invoke a full shame response. In this situation, the voyeur is able to both observe the target respond to his presence, without preventing her from performing whatever action he had intended to observe. The anxiety is heightened even further than if more successfully hidden, as the target is suspicious, further heightening the eroticism.

The following diagram summarizes all the cases together, contrasted with Nagel's ideal case: ![voyeurism summary]({{ site.url }}/assets/voyeurism/arousal_full.jpg)

In summary, depending on the complicity of the target, voyeurism is either a facet of sadism in which knowledge rather than force is power, or a mutual playing-out of a voyeuristic/exhibitionist fantasy, in which the fantasy originates from the social institution of privacy.
