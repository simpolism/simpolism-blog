At that moment, unreality of reality before him, he realized his fallacy in talking about an "I". He felt himself positioned within the continual, lifelong adaptation process between him and his environments. Why did he start smoking? The habit felt almost forced upon him, untethered from his will. What happened? He explains:

"The City erases moments. The sunrises and sunsets fall behind building walls, individually significant events snubbed out by the din of traffic and commotion. One has to make their own moments, or they'll never have a moment to spare. The city never stops; ever-present loneliness yet never truly alone. Where's one to go for some peace? Why do you think everyone smokes here? Adaptation."

This unfolding, of a human self into and back from their environment, is more akin to a folding, of a protein. One's DNA encoding serves as a rough plan for amino acids, arranging themselves, manifesting through their game of 4D Stochastic Chess. Simple energies formed into a complex yet somehow functional whole, in tandem with whatever is in their environment. Sometimes the protein fails. But, other times, this blob of organic matter becomes something special, something essential for life itself.

(The point of personal ethics, then, isn't to control one's ethical decision-making, but one's environmental meta-decision-making. Taking "Respect Thy Neighbor" seriously won't make you respect your neighbor any more or less, but it will push you to live in a place with more respect-worthy neighbors. Cybernetics.)
