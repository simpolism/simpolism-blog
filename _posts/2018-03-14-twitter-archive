I share many of my best thoughts on Twitter. On this page, I'll compile some of the threads I've written since creating my account in September, 2017.

I tend to write in "branching" threads, best visualized as "trees".  If a tweet in the root's thread has replies, consider clicking on the tweet to see if it has branching sub-threads in the replies. A tool like [Treeverse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/treeverse/aahmjdadniahaicebomlagekkcnlcila?hl=en) might also be helpful, but it is under-featured. Apparently, Twitter used to have an API that made better visualization tools possible, but it was removed several years ago. Noticing this, I've been trying to write with fewer branches, although a few sneak in anyway.
